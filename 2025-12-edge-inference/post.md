# Problem

you develop something that should work in the field, it something not trivial and does not fit into esp32 or arduino
maybe it is an item counting app or QR code detector with extra logic, or dimensioner, i.e. something that requires a pipeline of several small (yolo/resnet like) models to run relatively fast
and you want your system to run independently of internet connection, so you want to run it on the edge

what options do you have? how expensive are they? how easy is it to use conventional tools (pytorch for example)? how much power they consume, i.e. how long your system can run on a battery?
